************
Introduction
************

Suppose we want to surface a Snort alert in Cyphon::

    May 16 13:00:15 whimsy snort[3115]: [1:469:1] ICMP PING NMAP 
    [Classification: Attempted Information Leak] [Priority: 2]: 
    {ICMP} 10.120.66.1:21 -> 10.22.33.106:21

We want the parsed message to look like this::

    {
        "sys_timestamp": "2017-05-16T13:00:15.000Z",
        "host": "whimsy",
        "generator_id": 1,
        "signature_id": 469,
        "signature": "ICMP PING NMAP",
        "classification": "Attempted Information Leak",
        "priority": "2",
        "protocol": "ICMP",
        "source_ip": 10.120.66.1,
        "source_port": "21",
        "destination_ip": "10.22.33.106",
        "destination_port": "21"
    }

We could either use Cyphon to parse and save the message through a LogChute, or we could use Logstash to parse the message and send it directly to Cyphon's Watchdogs. In this tutorial, we'll use the Logstash shortcut. Although we'll only cover the main aspects of the Logstash configuration here, you can see a full example on `Cyphondock <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/tree/master/config-COPYME/logstash/>`__.


****************
Step 1: Filebeat
****************

We'll use Filebeat to send our Snort logs to Logstash. Consult Filebeat's
`official documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html>`__ for full details.

Prospector
==========

Within the ``filebeat.yml`` configuration file, set up a Filebeat prospector to label the Snort log messages as "snort," so we can easily identify them::

    filebeat.prospectors:

    - input_type: log
      paths:
        - /var/log/snort/*.log
      document_type: snort

Be sure to change the ``path`` to the location where you're actually sending Snort alerts.

Output
======

Next, specify an output to send the logs to Logstash, for example::

    output.logstash:
      hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

If Filebeat and Logstash are on different machines, be sure to change the ``hosts`` setting to reflect the address of your Logstash server.

.. note::

    If you're using a Logstash Docker container for local testing of your Filebeat configuration, the ``hosts`` might instead be ``["logstash:5044"]``.


****************
Step 2: Logstash
****************

Once Filebeat is setup, we can configure Logstash to receive the logs. Consult Logstash's
`official documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html>`__ for full details. You can also find an example of this Logstash pipeline on `Cyphondock <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/tree/master/config-COPYME/logstash/pipeline/>`__.

Input
=====

First, we'll create a Logstash input for Filebeat::

    input {
        beats {
            port => 5044
        }
    }

This port matches the port we specified in the Filebeat configuration for Logstash output.

Filters
=======

Next, we'll construct a couple of Logstash filters to process the message.

The first filter will:

    1) identify messages from Snort
    2) parse the messages into individual fields
    3) translate the timestamp field into a datetime that can be indexed

.. code::

    filter {

        if [type] == "snort" {

            # parse the message into individual fields
            grok {
                match => { "message" => "(?<ts>.*\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})\s(?<host>.*?)\s.*?\s\[(?<generator_id>.*?)::(?<signature_id>.*?):.*?\]\s(?<signature>.*?)\s\[Classification:\s(?<classification>.*?)\]\s\[Priority:\s(?<priority>.*?)\].*?{(?<protocol>.*?)\}\s(?<source_ip>.*?):(?<source_port>.*?)\s-\>\s(?<destination_ip>.*?):(?<destination_port>.*)" }
            }

            # remove the original message if parsing was successful
            if !("_grokparsefailure" in [tags]) {
                mutate {
                    remove_field => [ "message" ]
                }
            }

            # parse the timestamp and save in a new datetime field
            if [ts] {
                date {
                    match => [ "ts", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
                    target => "sys_timestamp"
                }

                # remove the original timestamp if date parsing was successful
                if !("_dateparsefailure" in [tags]) {
                    mutate {
                        remove_field => [ "ts" ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

The second filter will add the following fields to help Cyphon locate the data:

    1) a universally unique identifier (uuid) for the document
    2) a reference to the index where the document will be saved

.. code::

    filter {

        uuid {
            target => "@uuid"
        }

        mutate {
            add_field => {
                "collection" => "elasticsearch.cyphon.%{type}"
            }
        }
    }

When the document is saved, ``%{type}`` will be replaced by the ``document_type`` we specified in the Filebeat prospector, so the ``collection`` will be "elasticsearch.cyphon.snort".

Output
======

Finally, we need to tell Logstash where to send the parsed messages. 
Our Logstash output configuration will:

    1) save the message in a time-stamped Elasticsearch index
    2) use the @uuid field as the Elasticsearch document id
    3) send a copy of the message to Cyphon for inspection by Watchdogs

.. code::

    output {

        # save events to Elasticsearch with the uuid as the document id
        elasticsearch {
            hosts => ["elasticsearch"]
            index => "cyphon-%{+YYYY-MM-dd}"
            document_id => "%{@uuid}"
        }

        # send Snort messages to Cyphon Watchdogs via RabbitMQ
        if [type] == "snort" {
            rabbitmq {
                host => "rabbit"
                port => 5672
                exchange => "cyphon"
                exchange_type => "direct"
                key => "watchdogs"
                user => "guest"
                password => "guest"
                vhost => "cyphon"
                durable => true
                persistent => true
            }
        }
    }


**************
Step 3: Cyphon
**************

Although we're using Logstash to parse and store our logs, we need to let Cyphon know a bit about what's happening.

Container
=========

.. image:: ../_static/images/icons/container.png
    :width: 60px
    :align: left

We can tell Cyphon what fields of the document are important to us by creating a Container for those fields. We're not performing any extra analyses on the document, so we don't need a Label for the Container, just a Bottle.

Let's revisit our parsed document::

    {
        "sys_timestamp": "2017-05-16T13:00:15.000Z",
        "host": "whimsy",
        "generator_id": 1,
        "signature_id": 469,
        "signature": "ICMP PING NMAP",
        "classification": "Attempted Information Leak",
        "priority": "2",
        "protocol": "ICMP",
        "source_ip": 10.120.66.1,
        "source_port": "0",
        "destination_ip": "10.22.33.106",
        "destination_port": "0"
    }

To make a Container for this document, open the "Shaping Data" panel on Cyphon's main admin page. Create the following BottleFields:

    ================  =====================  ===========
    Field Name        Field Type             Target Type
    ================  =====================  ===========
    sys_timestamp     DateTimeField          DateTime
    host              CharField
    generator_id      CharField
    signature_id      CharField
    signature         CharField
    classification    CharField              Keyword
    priority          CharField
    protocol          CharField
    source_ip         GenericIPAddressField  IPAddress
    source_port       CharField
    destination_ip    GenericIPAddressField  IPAddress
    destination_port  CharField
    ================  =====================  ===========

.. note:

    If you're wondering why we're storing ports and other numbers as CharFields instead of IntegerFields, it's because numeric fields are usually reserved for values which have mathematical meaning (can be added, multiplied, etc.).

Add these BottleFields to a Bottle called "snort".

Next, create a Container using the "snort" Bottle. Define a Taste for the Container with the following properties:

    ==============  ==============
    Taste.author    host
    Taste.title     classification
    taste.content   signature
    taste.datetime  sys_timestamp
    ==============  ==============

.. note::

    You could also add a "location" to this Taste by adding a `geoip filter <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-geoip.html>`__ to your Logstash configuration and then including the ``geoip.location`` field in the "snort" Container. Refer to Cyphondock's `Snort filter <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/config-COPYME/logstash/pipeline/2-filter4-snort.conf>`__ and `starter fixtures <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/config-COPYME/cyphon/fixtures/starter-fixtures.json>`__ for an example.

Distillery
==========

.. image:: ../_static/images/icons/distillery.png
    :width: 100px
    :align: left

Next, we need to specify where the data is located. To do this, we'll create a Distillery, which defines the data store and the data schema for our document. The data schema is represented by the Distillery's Container (which we just created). The data store is represented by the Distillery's Collection.

Before we create the Collection, we first need to establish a Warehouse for it.
You can create the Warehouse by opening the "Storing Data" panel on Cyphon's main admin page.

The name of the Warehouse will correspond to the name of the index we specified in our Logstash output configuration, which was "cyphon-%{+YYYY-MM-dd}". However, we won't include the date in the Warehouse name; instead, we'll simply name it "cyphon" and set it as a "time series" index. This setting will create a new Elasticsearch index every day, with the current date appended to the Warehouse name.

.. note::
    
    Time-series indexes make it easier to archive or delete old data. See Elasticsearch's documentation on `retiring data <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/retiring-data.html>`__ for more info. 

The Warehouse will thus have the following properties:

    =====================  =============
    Warehouse.backend      elasticsearch
    Warehouse.name         cyphon
    Warehouse.time_series  True
    =====================  =============

The name of the Collection in this Warehouse will correspond to the ``document_type`` we specified in our Filebeat prospector:

    ====================  ========
    Collection.warehouse  cyphon
    Collection.name       snort
    ====================  ========

Under the "Distilling Data" panel on the main admin page, create a Distillery that uses this Collection and the Container we previously created:

    =====================  ==========================
    Distillery.collection  elasticsearch.cyphon.snort
    Distillery.container   snort
    Distillery.is_shell    True
    =====================  ==========================

Watchdog
========

.. container:: clearfix

   .. image:: ../_static/images/icons/watchdog.png
      :width: 100px
      :align: left

   Now that Cyphon knows where the document is stored and what it looks like, we can create a Watchdog to inspect it. We'll create some simple rulesets that will generate Alerts according to the priority of the Snort alert.

.. note::

    Watchdogs are able to inspect fields in a document even if we didn't include them in our Container. In this case, we'll make use of the ``type`` field, which is the field Elasticsearch uses to store the ``document_type`` (which we orginally defined in our Filebeat prospector).

Let's start by making some DataRules to identify Snort Alerts of different priorites. Under the "Sifting Data" panel on the main admin page, click on "JSON Data" and create the following DataRules:

    =================  ===========  =========  =======
    DataRule Name      Field Name   Operator   Value
    =================  ===========  =========  =======
    type_equals_snort  type         equals     snort
    priority_equals_1  priority     equals     1
    priority_equals_2  priority     equals     2
    priority_equals_3  priority     equals     3
    =================  ===========  =========  =======

We can then use these DataRules to create DataSieves that a Watchdog will use to inspect the document:

    ==============================  =====  ==================  ==================
    DataSieve Name                  Logic  Node 1 (data rule)  Node 2 (data rule)
    ==============================  =====  ==================  ==================
    Snort alert - high priority     AND    type_equals_snort   priority_equals_1
    Snort alert - medium priority   AND    type_equals_snort   priority_equals_2
    Snort alert - low priority      AND    type_equals_snort   priority_equals_3
    Snort alert - unknown priority  AND    type_equals_snort
    ==============================  =====  ==================  ==================

Now go to the "Configuring Alerts" panel and create the Watchdog:

    ================  ========    
    Watchdog.name     Snort
    Watchdog.enabled  True
    ================  ======== 

Add the following Triggers to the Watchdog:

    ==============================  ===============  ======== 
    DataSieve                       Alert Level      Rank
    ==============================  ===============  ========
    Snort alert - high priority     High             0
    Snort alert - medium priority   Medium           10
    Snort alert - low priority      Low              20
    Snort alert - unknown priority  Medium           30
    ==============================  ===============  ========

It's important that the "Snort alert - unknown priority" rule has the lowest rank; we only want it to come into play if none of the other rules have matched a document.

.. note::

    Although we could assign ranks of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the Triggers, we're using 0, 10, 20, and 30 to make it easier to insert additional Triggers at a later date.


****************
Step 4: Receiver
****************

Now all we have to do is start some queue consumers for Logstash's RabbitMQ output.

If you're using `Cyphondock <https://github.com/dunbarcyber/cyphondock/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>`__ or installed Cyphon from our `ISO <https://www.cyphon.io/download/>`__ (which uses Cyphondock), you don't need to do anything more; you should already have watchdog containers running, which will act as queue consumers.

If you're running a manual install, though, you'll need to create some watchdog queue consumers using the command line. From the Cyphon project directory, you can enter this command::

    python receiver/receiver.py watchdogs 4

This will create four queue consumers for a RabbitMQ queue called "watchdogs" that's associated with the "watchdogs" routing key. This is the same routing key we specified in our Logstash output configuration for RabbitMQ.

You should now start to see Cyphon Alerts from Snort!


**********
Conclusion
**********

In this tutorial, we've shown how you can use Logstash to quickly deliver data to Cyphon's Watchdogs. Although we only used a log message in our example, Logstash has a number of `input plugins <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html>`__ that handle a variety of other forms of data, which you can send to Cyphon as well!
